<h2>House Price Prediction using Machine Learning</h2>

🧾Summary:

📈 Predicts house prices based on key features using supervised machine learning regression techniques.

🔍 Overview

🏡 Real estate pricing depends on multiple factors like location, size, and number of rooms.✅
This project builds a machine learning regression model to predict house prices accurately using historical housing data.
The goal is learning + practical application, not claiming industry-level perfection.✅

❓ Problem Statement

 ✅Manually estimating house prices is inconsistent and biased.

 
🎯 Objective: 
✅Build a machine learning model that predicts house prices based on given features with reasonable accuracy.

📊 Dataset <a href="https://github.com/rajankumar-1439/student-performance-prediction-ml/blob/main/student_habits_performance.csv">House Price dataset</a>

🔑 Features Used 

✅ Area (sqft)

✅ Number of Bedrooms

✅ Number of Bathrooms

✅ Floors

✅ Location-related attributes (if available)


🎯 Target Variable

✅ House Price


🛠️ Tools & Technologies

✅ Python, ✅ NumPy, ✅ Pandas, ✅ Matplotlib / Seaborn (EDA & visualization), ✅ Scikit-learn, ✅ Jupyter Notebook


⚙️ Methodology

Step-by-step workflow 👇

1️⃣ Data loading and inspection

2️⃣ Data cleaning (null values, incorrect entries)

3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

4️⃣ Feature selection

5️⃣ Train-test split

6️⃣ Model training (Regression model)

7️⃣ Model evaluation using performance metrics



🧠 Machine Learning Model

✅ Model Used:

Linear Regression / Decision Tree Regression (based on your notebook)

✅ Why Regression?

Because price prediction is a continuous value problem, not classification.

📈 Key Insights

🔹 House price increases with area (expected, but verified

🔹 Certain features contribute more strongly to price prediction

🔹 Model performance depends heavily on data quality



🖥️ Dashboard / Model Output

📊 Output includes:

✅Predicted house price for given input features

✅Evaluation metrics such as:

--R² Score

--Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
